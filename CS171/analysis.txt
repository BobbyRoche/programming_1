Analysis:

1.) Unknown value predictions

ages.csv Year = 2020 Age = 31

hurricanes.csv Year = 3000 Hurricanes = 18.33318

temp.csv Year = 2030 Temp = 58.29949

voters.csv Year = 2012 Voters = 262.00952

weight.csv Height = 100 Weight = 347.22375

These are predicitons for values that are not given. They seem to follow the trend of the line,but may be slightly
off from the exact numbers since things like hurricanes are not on a fixed schedule. 

2.) The accuracy of the program seems to be quite accurate, however there is always room for improvement. 
It definitely is not exact, but it is only off by a few decimals from what I can tell. Adding more entries
to the csv files would improve accuracy. Technically since some decimals are infinite, the program cannot be
one hundred percent accurate on all entries, but could get infinitely close to perfect accuracy as entries are added.
